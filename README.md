The DHFR_SCA_analysis.ipynb jupyter notebook file contains all of the scripting necessary to analyze the uploaded trajectory files by SCA assignment. Supplemental analysis of dihedral angles and hinge distances can be run using the Dihedrals and Hinge distance notebook. Analysis of the multi-sequence alignment for identification of mutant frequency can be done with the align_search.py code. The alignment, processed alignment, and database from SCA are available. To run the SCA_analysis.py script the scaTools package is necessary.
